# DEMONSTRATION PROCEDURE

set up 4 windows in Terminator for gazebo, mapping, rviz and programm



1) No obstacles
map time = 30 sec
roslaunch uol_cmp9767m_base thorvald-sim.launch obstacles:=false map_server:=true fake_localisation:=true
roslaunch uol_cmp9767m_tutorial mapping_fake_localisation.launch

After spraying, put box in front in gazebo and demo move_base avoidance

Then discuss look ahead feature in global costmap, but doesn't work well - incorrect map
DEmo problems with obstacles:= true









2) With obstacles
map time = 30 sec
roslaunch uol_cmp9767m_base thorvald-sim.launch obstacles:=true map_server:=true fake_localisation:=true
roslaunch uol_cmp9767m_tutorial mapping_fake_localisation.launch


|  Demonstrate 'mapping', traversing and spraying on empty field
1) No obstacles, map_server:=true  	|  amcl_localisation	|  Show again with amcl localisation
2) No obstacles, map_server:=false 	|  fake_localisation	|  Move_base fails - why??
3) With obstacles, map_server:=true  	|  fake_localisation	|  robot gets stuck because only using local costmap
4) With obstacles, no map_server:=false |  fake_localisation	|   Fails!





# TO RUN PROGRAM

# 1) Launch Gazebo:
without gmapping, uses blank map:
roslaunch uol_cmp9767m_base thorvald-sim.launch obstacles:=true map_server:=true

with gmapping:
roslaunch uol_cmp9767m_base thorvald-sim.launch obstacles:=true 


# 2) launch move_base server:
roslaunch uol_cmp9767m_tutorial mapping_amcl.launch
or 
roslaunch uol_cmp9767m_tutorial mapping_fake_localisation.launch



# 3) run program:
rosrun my_examples move_avoid_zap.py



# Set-up ROS and CMP9767m

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-uol-cmp9767m-base 
(if this latter resulted in error, there's a conflicting package installed, try sudo apt-get purge "*gazebo*" first, and then install again). 
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash


# to create workspace
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash  
mkdirâ€“p ~/catkin_ws/src  
cd ~/catkin_ws/src  
catkin_init_workspace  
cd ~/catkin_ws  
catkin_make or catkin build  

# To create a new package:
MUST BE IN THE ~/catkin_ws/src DIRECTORY BEFORE RUNNING CATKIN_CREATE_PKG
cd ~/catkin_ws/src  
catkin_create_pkg my_package_namerospy  

# Point to note, 
always source bash when in new terminal by: 
source devel/setup.bash  (now in setup.bash)

# to kill Gazebo after crash:  
killall -9 gzserver  

# to run rviz
rviz rviz -d ~/catkin_ws/src/my_examples/rviz_config/mapping.rviz


# To add robot model  
add by display type, robot model  
change description to /thorvald_001/robot_description  

# Dont forget that add bt topic has a lot of options:  
E.g.  particecloud, amcl_pose and scan to see localaization (select fixed frame to map)  
E.g. odometry/base_raw and odometry/filtered to effect of Kalman filer (select fixed frame to odom)

# Tune amcl
Adjust max and min point numbers to stop jumping


# git commands
Code should be in ~/catkin_ws/src/my_examples/src/scripts/Robot-Programming  
cd to this directory  
git add .  
git commit  
Type commit message, ctrl o ctrl x to save and exit  
git push Bluboy456  smxxxxxxxx8  

# robot steering 
rosrun rqt_robot_steering rqt_robot_steering  
set topic to /thorvald_001/teleop_joy/cmd_vel  
(can ignore warning message)  

  
# Linux boot issues
Reinstalling REfInd from MacOS fixes boot to grub problem
