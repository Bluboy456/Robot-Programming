# Set-up ROS and CMP9767m

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-uol-cmp9767m-base 
(if this latter resulted in error, there's a conflicting package installed, try sudo apt-get purge "*gazebo*" first, and then install again). 
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash


# to create workspace
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
mkdirâ€“p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make or catkin build

# To create a new package:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg my_package_namerospy

# Point to note, 
always source bash when in new terminal by:
source devel/setup.bash  (now in setup.bash)

# to run thorvald:
roslaunch uol_cmp9767m_base thorvald-sim.launch
